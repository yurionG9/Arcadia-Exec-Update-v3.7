## What Is Arcadia?

**Arcadia** is a **Luau sandbox and learning environment** for **Roblox Studio** developers. It gives beginner and intermediate Luau programmers a comfortable place to practice, prototype, and share ideas outside of the Studio IDE — with a fast code editor, sample library, and profile-based project management.

Arcadia is designed for **Roblox game development**, **Luau tutorials**, and **script prototyping workflows**. It follows Roblox's developer guidelines and is intended for use with **your own Studio projects**, **Team Create sessions you own**, and **local .rbxl files** — not for live user games you don't have permission to modify.

**Topics this project covers:** roblox studio, luau, roblox development, lua learning, roblox scripting tutorials, luau sandbox, roblox studio helper tools.
